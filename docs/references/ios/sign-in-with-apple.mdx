# Sign in with Apple

> [!WARNING]
> The Clerk iOS SDK is currently in beta. It is **not yet recommended for production use**.

This guide will teach you how to add native Sign in with Apple to your Clerk apps on Apple platforms.

<Steps>
  ### Configure the Apple social connection

  To support native Sign in with Apple, you need to configure the [Apple social connection](/docs/authentication/social-connections/apple) in your Clerk dashboard.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Be sure to follow the instructions specific to native sign in with Apple flows.

  ### Add the Sign in with Apple capability to your app

  [Add the Sign in with Apple capability to your app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/configuring-sign-in-with-apple#Add-the-Sign-in-with-Apple-capability-to-your-app).

  ### Obtain an Apple ID Credential

  To authenticate with Clerk using native Sign in with Apple in your app you need to obtain an [Apple ID Credential](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/asauthorizationappleidcredential).
  In order to obtain the credential:

  1. You can use one of [Apple's built-in Sign in with Apple buttons](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/sign_in_with_apple/displaying_sign_in_with_apple_buttons_in_your_app).
  1. You can do so manually by following the [Apple docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/sign_in_with_apple/implementing_user_authentication_with_sign_in_with_apple#3546457).

  > [!NOTE]
  > You must set the nonce property of the `ASAuthorizationAppleIDRequest` when requesting an Apple ID Credential in order to authenticate with Clerk.

  ### Sign In / Sign Up

  Once you have obtained your [Apple ID Credential](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/asauthorizationappleidcredential), you can use it to authenticate with Clerk by calling `SignIn.signInWithAppleIdToken()` or `SignUp.signUpWithAppleIdToken()`

  ```swift {{ filename: 'SignIn' }}
  static func signInWithAppleIdToken(
    idToken: String,
    code: String? = nil
  ) async throws -> ExternalAuthResult?
  ```

  ```swift {{ filename: 'SignUp' }}
  static func signUpWithAppleIdToken(
    idToken: String,
    code: String? = nil,
    firstName: String? = nil,
    lastName: String? = nil,
    captchaToken: String? = nil
  ) async throws -> ExternalAuthResult?
  ```

  You can access the necessary identity token on the Apple ID Credential with the following code:

  ```swift
  let idToken = credential.identityToken.flatMap({ String(data: $0, encoding: .utf8) })
  ```

  You can access the optional authorization code in the same way:

  ```swift
  let code = credential.authorizationCode.flatMap({ String(data: $0, encoding: .utf8) })
  ```

  ### Tying it all together

  This example uses Apple's built-in `SignInWithAppleButton`

  ```swift {{ filename: 'SignInWithAppleView.swift' }}
  import SwiftUI
  import ClerkSDK
  import AuthenticationServices

  struct SignInWithAppleView: View {
    var body: some View {
      SignInWithAppleButton { request in
        request.requestedScopes = [.email, .fullName]
        request.nonce = UUID().uuidString // Setting the nonce is mandatory
      } onCompletion: { result in
        Task {
          guard let credential = try result.get().credential as? ASAuthorizationAppleIDCredential else {
            dump("Unable to get credential of type ASAuthorizationAppleIDCredential")
            return
          }
          
          guard let token = credential.identityToken.flatMap({ String(data: $0, encoding: .utf8) }) else {
            dump("Unable to get ID token from Apple ID Credential.")
            return
          }
          
          let authCode = credential.authorizationCode.flatMap({ String(data: $0, encoding: .utf8) })
          
          try await SignIn.signInWithAppleIdToken(
            idToken: token,
            code: authCode
          )
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
</Steps>
